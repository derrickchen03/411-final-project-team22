Steps required
1.) Generate API key for weatherapi.com, and enter it into the template .env file.
2.) Run run_docker.sh script

Since the SQLAlchemy database is initialized in app.py, through the running of the docker script, everything needed should theoretically be loaded on at startup.

Variables defined in .env
API_KEY=
DB_URI=sqlite:///users.db
CREATE_DB=true
